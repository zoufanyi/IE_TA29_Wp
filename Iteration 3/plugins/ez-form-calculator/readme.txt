== Installation ==
Install the plugin in the common way. After the installation, you'll see a new menu named "ez Form Calculator" in your dashboard.

On the main page of the plugin, you can add forms with the plus button in the forms section. Add form elements by clicking on any element in the elements list on the right side. You can also drag and drop the elements to the desired position.

Subsequently, you can click on the element in the form builder section to open it. Depending on the element type, you can add your custom value to the value option, set its factor or add values to checkbox/radio options. The plugin will calculate these values automatically as soon as the user changes any element in the form.
